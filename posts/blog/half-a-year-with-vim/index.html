Likely, I code in go, so it’s pretty
easy to switch. I mean, I tried to do Java with vim for about a week -
and it’s a hell. So if your primary language requires massive IDE support,
it’s not an option to completely switch to vim.</p><p>After slightly more than half a year of usage, I improved typing,
navigation speed, and general comfort while I code.</p><p>Before I was using a mouse to navigate between files,
scrolling them to find something, But with vim,
your movements are minimal and efficient.</p><p>Also, it makes you think a bit more. Not only because you need to remember a
lot of commands and combinations, but because you always try to do something
by pressing the minimum number of keys possible.</p><p>I am going to describe my experience on how to start and make an
overview of the configuration I use.</p><h2 id=how-to-start>How to start</h2><h3 id=basics>Basics</h3><p>As a first step, to understand the basics, I suggest trying embedded vim tutor. You can run it by:</p><pre><code>$ vimtutor
</code></pre><p>It should be installed by default.</p><p>It’s a text file divided into lessons which will teach you to navigate, edit,
search and more - basics enough for daily use. I was doing this tutorial for a couple of
weeks until I was confident with each lesson.</p><p>Once you got used to <code>hjkl</code> navigation, stop doing it. The main power of vim is
navigation and clicking <code>hhhhhh</code> to get to another line, for instance, is
super inefficient. It can be as hard as switching to vim, but you will not
regret. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnUiHLYZgaA">good video</a> about it.</p><h3 id=configuration>Configuration</h3><p>Some people suggest to use vanilla vim to start with, so you can understand
which functions you luck of comparing to IDE/editor you used to and do not
install a lot of useless plugins.</p><p>However, I think it makes sense to find the most popular configuration
for a language you use on GitHub and use it as a base.</p><p>After some time you most likely will optimize it for your usage.
I did exactly same, started with <a href=https://github.com/farazdagi/vim-go-ide>vim-go-ide</a>
and then <a href=https://github.com/ngalayko/vim-go-ide>forked it</a>.</p><h2 id=configuration-overwiew>Configuration overwiew</h2><p>Here is a list of plugins I use:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox>gruvbox</a> - really good color scheme (I prefer dark version)</li><li><a href=https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim>deoplete.nvim</a> - fast-auto completion,
